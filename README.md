## CopyCat (Rust)

CopyCat is a basic clipboard manager that stores recently clipped items, and also allows storage of custom clips.

CopyCat is written entirely in rust and utilized the egui library. 

This project taught me how to use rust to:
- read and write files to drive
- create threads
- listen for clipboard events without blocking the UI
- utilize Egui library to create a simple UI to interact with
- set clipboard values
