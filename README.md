## Chaos Manager (Solid, PostgreSQL, Actix, Rust)

Chaos manager is not your typical todo list style app. It allows you to prioritize tasks and times of day to accomplish those todos. 

Chaos manager is written in TypeScript and Rust.

This project enabled me to learn:
- Solid
  - Front end library
  - Written in TypeScript
- Actix
  - Rust web service library
  - Create endpoints to support CRUD operations on tasks, categories and time blocks
- Rust
  - Write SQL queries against local database

## CopyCat (Rust)

CopyCat is a basic clipboard manager that stores recently clipped items, and also allows storage of custom clips.

CopyCat is written entirely in rust and utilized the egui library. 

This project taught me how to use rust to:
- read and write files to drive
- create threads
- listen for clipboard events without blocking the UI
- utilize Egui library to create a simple UI to interact with
- set clipboard values
